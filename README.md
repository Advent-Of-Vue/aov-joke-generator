[Advent Of Vue](https://adventofvue.com) is a series of 24 Vue coding challenges that are sent out every day from December 1 to December 24 via [a dedicated newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/AdventOfVue). If you'd like to receive more of these puzzles in the future, go ahead and sign up!

## Problem description

We all can use a little bit more joy in our lives. So it's time to tell jokes!

- Use the `https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/christmas` API endpoint to load a joke.
- First, render the setup text.
- Then, add a `Tell Me!` button that we can click to reveal the delivery text.
- After revealing the delivery text, render an `Another` button which loads the next joke.
- Hint: you can look at the `./src/App.spec.js` file to see a specification of the desired outcome.
- Hint: you can run the tests with `npm run test` to see if your solution matches the specification.

If you like how, in this example, you can check your implementation with an existing test, you might be interested in my [book/newsletter about how to write good tests for Vue applications](https://goodvuetests.com/).
